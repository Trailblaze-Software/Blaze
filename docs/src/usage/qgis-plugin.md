# QGIS Plugin

The **Blaze Map Loader** plugin simplifies importing processed results into QGIS and allows automatic downloading of NSW topographic data.

## Installation

1. Download the latest plugin zip file from [https://github.com/Trailblaze-Software/Blaze/releases](https://github.com/Trailblaze-Software/Blaze/releases).

2. Install in QGIS using `Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > Install from ZIP`.

3. Install suggested dependencies. You will likely need to install the Compass Routes plugin manually from [https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/compass_routes/](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/compass_routes/).

## Usage

Once enabled, look for the Blaze icon in your QGIS toolbar or under the **Plugins** menu. Use the dialog to select your Blaze output directory and load the data.
