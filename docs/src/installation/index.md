# Installation

The easiest way to install Blaze is to download pre-built binaries from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/Trailblaze-Software/Blaze/releases/latest).

## Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from:

**[https://github.com/Trailblaze-Software/Blaze/releases/latest](https://github.com/Trailblaze-Software/Blaze/releases/latest)**

For most users on Windows, this will be `Blaze-x.x.x-win64-x64.exe`. You will likely need to tell Windows that the download is safe and to keep anyway.

## Building from Source

If you need to build from source or want to contribute to the project, see the [Building from Source](build-from-source.md) guide.
